# IntroToProg-Python-Mod07
This repository is for Module07 of Intro to Programming - Python.

Introduction
The purpose of Assignment 07 is to demonstrate how Pickling and Structured Error Handling work. I created this script in PyCharm and utilized PyCharm and Terminal to ensure it runs properly. Please see references for resources I used in my research. I am working on a Mac OS.

Strategy
I utilized a similar structure to our recent assignments that allows the user to input their selection out of four menu options. The options are to input data to be pickled, load and print data that has been pickled and saved in a text file, initiate a demo of structured error handling, or exit the program.

Script
Below are screenshots from PyCharm of the script for Assignment 07. The first section of code is the change log, declaration of global variables, and definition of the menu function. Note that I have imported “pickle” to allow for the pickling functions to be used.
